# Summary
This workspace explores a implementation of the famous `FizzBuzz` game, that that
focuses on flexibility and extensibility.

# Build
As long as no binary that uses the `fizz_buzz` library is implemented (//TODO: !), you
see how the implementation works by writing integration tests [here](./lib/fizz_buzz/src/test.rs)
